<h2>Our Missions And Missionaries.</h2>


<p>It is our custom to publish in the second issue of the Magazine for each
year a catalogue of the churches, institutions and schools into which we
place the offerings devoted by those who send them, to the great work of
the American Missionary Association.</p>

<p>If our readers will look carefully at this, and preserve it for future
reference,
they will come into sympathy more easily and truly with those who
have gone from our Christian homes and churches in the name of Christ
and for his sake.</p>

<p>These pages of names and places represent many things:</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">First.</span>&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">The work.</span> Our missionaries are among four races, the
white,
the black, the red and the yellow. These are children of a common
Father; they are under the dominion of a common sinfulness; they are
the possible heirs of a common Saviour. We go to them with the same
gospel, which is able to save them to the same fellowship of faith and
love on earth and to the same heaven.</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Secondly.</span>&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">The missionaries and the characteristics of their
work.</span> There
are represented in this list, teachers of theology, teachers of language,
of history, of philosophy and of science. There are teachers of "common
branches" and "higher branches." There are teachers of industries
for men and women, house-makers and home-makers. There are preachers
to organized churches and preachers at large whose work is to gather
churches. They are all alike missionaries.</p>

<p>Notice, also, what a large proportion of our missionary work is being
done by Christian women. Well did Secretary Hiatt say, "The history of
this Association is a grand and splendid eulogy of woman." "Our sisters
who went South while the sky was yet heavy with the clouds of war from
the homes of refinement and culture and religion," are many of them
remaining

until now, and they are continually re-enforced from our best institutions
of learning in the East and in the West. There is a common
fidelity on the shores of the Gulf, in the mountains of the South and
among the tribes of the plains. These men and women in our churches
and schools who have given themselves in consecration and sacrifice to
this service are leading those who have been crushed by oppressions and
wrongs of men, and who have been degraded in ignorance and in sin, to
rise into a new life, and into new habits of thought and feeling.</p>

<p>They are working to rescue millions from the woful inheritances of the
pitiless centuries. They are teaching those who are to be the teachers of
their people. They are preparing those who shall lead their own peoples.
It is not a work of a score of years, nor of half a century. It is a
part of the work of Christianity, whatever time it may take, and we ask
those who pray "<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Thy kingdom come</span>" to remember these missionary
teachers
and preachers before God that they may be of good courage, faithful
and patient in their ministering.</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Thirdly.</span>&mdash;<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">These pages represent also the faith and sacrifices of
Christians
by which this service of Jesus Christ goes on.</span> Brethren and sisters,
you
who
contribute to this work, read in these names assurances to gladden your
hearts and cheer your faith. See what solid regiments of the Master's
army are in the land where slavery has perished, but where the problems
which follow it are larger than ever before. Look up the locations of
these missionaries on the map, and see where they are, in the valleys
and on the mountains of the South, in plains of the far West, and on the
shores of the Pacific sea. They report cheering tidings. Their schools
are overflowing. Converts are being added to their churches. Our
institutions
are in harmony and zealous emulation. The year has opened
auspiciously, "And the best of all is, God is with us."</p>
</div>

<div>
<a name="toc_3"></a>

<p>The Rev. Frank E. Jenkins, who succeeded the Rev. C.J. Ryder as
a Field Superintendent, and who has served the Association since that time
with an untiring devotion and with signal ability, has at his own urgent
request been transferred from this general work to a specific part of the
field.</p>

<p>He has accepted the pastorate of the Congregational Church of New
Decatur, Ala., with which we are in co-operation. Our consent to this
change would have been the more reluctant but for the fact that we are in
heartiest sympathy with the missionary purposes contemplated in this
exchange
of service.</p>

<p>We congratulate the New Decatur church upon its entrance into its
tasteful edifice&mdash;recently dedicated,&mdash;with a pastor whom we relinquish
from the relationships of Field Superintendent only upon his own repeated
convictions of duty, and in view of his preference for this particular
work.</p>

<h2>Southern Notes.</h2>

<p>By Secretary A.F. Beard.</p>


<p>The "sleeper" had been transformed into a parlor car, which was used
that day chiefly by the colored porter and myself. The "paper-boy" came
through and offered me a New York <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Illustrated Weekly</span>, adorned on the
first page with the portrait of Jefferson Davis, for whom the South was
then mourning with great abundance of white and black cotton cloth.</p>

<p>After I had declined with thanks to invest in this picture, I turned to
the colored porter who was travelling in the white man's car in apparent
"social equality" and casually remarked, "Your people should feel very
grateful to Jefferson Davis for what he did for you. You ought to have
that picture." With a surprise that he could not conceal, he intimated that
he did not understand me. He "didn't care for it," and "didn't know
what Jeff Davis had done for his people."</p>

<p>Time being at some discount, I undertook to tell him that "Jefferson
Davis did more than any other person to take the South out of the Union.
He was chief among the secessionists. Then, as President, he made so
many mistakes, he did more than any other man to prevent the success of
the Confederacy. He did more to bring about the freedom of the slave
than any other man. Since the emancipation of your race came on as a
consequence of secession, why should you not be grateful to Jefferson
Davis and cherish his memory?"</p>

<p>The black man by this time had gathered himself up for his reply to my
Q.E.D. Not knowing what my sympathies might be, he replied in a slow
and careful way, "Well, sir, I can't see it as you do. The way it looks to
me is this, you know. In these days there are a good many people who
don't believe in God&mdash;not much&mdash;but I reckon it was God who set my
people free. You see, he didn't want that condition of things any longer.
It was God who did it, sir, that's what I think, and I don't believe it was
Jeff Davis. That's my view."</p>

<p>I did not argue the question further. When one gets down solid upon the
decrees, then I stop. But as the car rolled along with the speed usual on
Southern railways, I pondered the text, "The wrath of man shall praise
Him, and the remainder thereof shall he restrain."</p>

<br />

<p>He was a colored porter, and I may have transgressed the laws of
"social equality" in asking him aught other than to make up the berth,
and to call me early. With the judgment resting upon Geo. W. Cable&mdash;who
is never to be forgotten or forgiven because he had conference with
some colored people in Nashville, and did not insult them&mdash;one should be
very careful of his social equality. Nevertheless, I ventured to talk with
this colored porter. I asked him what he knew about his race, and what
he thought of his people and their prospects.</p>


<p>He said, "I was raised in North Carolina, never had much chance myself,
had only a country school to go to&mdash;kept by a colored man&mdash;not very
good teacher&mdash;pretty good&mdash;better than none. But there's good many
good schools now, and good many smart colored people by this time, sir.
There's a good many risin' all the time. Old Fred. Douglass is a right
smart man, you know; but then he sort o' left his race when he married a
white woman. We don't think so much of him as a leader as we used to."</p>

<p>The car rolled on. It was two hours late at my station. The bus
man who stood in the stage door and collected the fares was conversational.
He was unaware that by my ride and conversation in the car, I had forfeited
my "social equality" with him. Hence he did not ostracise me;
but smiling, said, "Train very late to-day, sir." "Isn't it usually as late
as this?" I asked. "Invariably, sir, except when it's later."</p>
</div>

<div>
<a name="toc_5"></a>
<h2>Paragraphs.</h2>

<p>Dr. Rankin, the newly-elected President of Howard University, writes:</p>

<p>"Everything at the University begins very promisingly. We had a
crowded preaching service on Sunday night, and are observing the week of
prayer at 12:30 noon. The meetings are full and impressive."</p>

<p>"If a donor should give a great material gift to the University, I am
sure I ought to write you. But the great Giver is giving us the choicest of
spiritual gifts. Eight of the students, one of them a senior, this noon
expressed
a desire for prayers. We continue the daily meeting at noon."</p>

<br />

<p>The immigration into the United States is steadily declining, as appears
by the figures reported in the papers, while the blending of the foreigners
here is steadily and rapidly going forward, rendering them speedily one
people. On the other hand, the colored population in the Southern States
is steadily augmenting, while the alienation between the black and white
races in the South is becoming more pronounced. The Southern problem
is the more difficult of solution.</p>

<br />

<p>A clergyman in a Southern town who is connected with families of great
influence, and who ministers to a large white church, is accustomed to
preach every afternoon in a colored church under the care of this
Association.
He usually repeats to the colored church the sermon preached in the
forenoon to his own people, and finds that those who hear it in the
afternoon appreciate it fully. The two remarkable facts in this incident
are that the gentleman should consent to do this gratuitous labor for the
colored church, and that the colored church should understand and
appreciate
the sermon prepared for the cultured white congregation.</p>

<h2>A Beautiful Gift.</h2>


<p>Mr. Silas M. Rideout, of Cumberland, Maine, has presented to the
American Missionary Association, through the Boston office, a most
beautiful
box for keepsakes. It is about 6 inches in width, 9 in length and 4 in
depth, made of inlaid woods of different colors very tastefully arranged,
"American Missionary" being set in the cover. The inside is lined with
plush. On a card in the box the following was written by a friend:
"This box was presented to the American Missionary Association by a
good man living in a small town in Maine, who, like that good fisherman of
whom we have heard, gives such as he had. This dear brother of
<span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">four-score</span>
and <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">two years</span>, made this box and presented it to the American
Missionary
Association, with its contents $10.25, which was contributed by
such of his friends as desired to have a look at the skill of their aged
brother in his work of love for the cause of Christ." It was intended by
our venerable friend that this box should draw other contributions and
finally be sold, the proceeds to be devoted to the work of the American
Missionary Association in which Mr. Rideout has been so deeply interested
for many years. A gentleman in Boston offers $12 for the box.
Will not some one make a better offer, and in this way recognize the
remarkable
skill of this aged friend in his effort to increase the income of
the Association to help the needy millions among whom our missionaries
labor?</p>

<h2>The Southern Situation.</h2>

<h2 class="sub">Some Suggestive Facts.</h2>


<p><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">First Fact.</span> The condition of the colored man In the South is
becoming
more pitiable and precarious. Mr. Grady, in his last speech, announced
the unalterable purpose of the Southern whites never to submit to Negro
rule, and we read not long since of a "quiet election" held in a Southern
city, because the colored people, duly warned, kept away from the polls.
We know something, also, of the struggles of that people against almost
insuperable difficulties in trying to obtain food, homes and education. In
addition to all this, the public press keeps us informed with sad frequency
of the repeated murders inflicted upon the defenceless colored people.</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Second Fact.</span> We learn with gratification that Southern people of
high
standing denounce these outrages. Governor Richardson, of South Carolina,
assured a colored delegation that called upon him, that he had offered
a reward for the apprehension of the Barnwell murderers, and pledged his
sacred word that nothing would be undone on his part to bring the lynchers
to condign punishment. Senator Wade Hampton is said to have endorsed
the sentiments of the Governor, and leading Southern papers have
censured in unmeasured terms this outrage.</p>

<p>But as yet these murderers have not been arrested, and we presume that

no one expects they will be. The murderers of Mr. Clayton, of Arkansas,
who presumed to run as an independent candidate for Congress, were
denounced by the authorities of the State, and rewards were offered for
their apprehension. But, though many months have elapsed, they have not
been arrested, and no one, North or South, imagines that they will be
punished. Kind words from Southern officials will not solve the great
problem.</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Third Fact.</span> The colored people bear up well under all these trying
circumstances. We should suppose they would be utterly discouraged, for
they see little prospect of securing their rights as men and citizens, and
even life and property are not safe. They are allured to a change of
location
by flaming handbills, making tempting but deceptive offers of better
wages and better homes. They are hunted down and massacred, and yet
their wrongs are unredressed.</p>

<p>But in spite of all this, they struggle on, constantly gaining property
and homes, some of them acquiring wealth. If they are deceived on reaching
some new Eldorado, losing their all in making the change, they do not
give up, but strike in again. If they are not safe in some rural districts,
they go to the cities. But best of all, their educated men are showing
great
wisdom and moderation, as witness the calm and dispassionate action of
the Convention of the most intelligent and influential colored men in
Charleston, S.C., after the Barnwell massacre. They passed resolutions
of dignified condemnation of the wrong, yet urged their people to remain
quiet, and let the proper authorities vindicate the law. The forbearance
of that meeting has won the commendations of leading white men in the
South.</p>

<p>And here let us say, that the white people of the South make no greater
mistake, than when they imagine that it is a dangerous thing to educate
the colored people. On the contrary, we believe that the facts make it
manifest that it is by these educated men that their race will be guided
wisely and safely through this great crisis, and that if a war of races is
to
be avoided, these educated colored men will be a grand factor in averting
it.</p>

<p><span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">Fourth Fact.</span> It is conceded by all right-thinking people, that the
education
of the colored race is the only true solution of the Southern problem.
This has been declared in Presidential messages, in the utterances of
such candid men as Dr. Curry, Dr. Haygood and Colonel Keating, by writers
in all the Northern religious papers, and is, we believe, the accepted
and settled opinion of Christian people at the North. Everybody admits,
also, that there is a crisis coming, and that what is done for Negro
education
must be done quickly. The North has a duty in this matter, and admits
it. Our constituents have a special duty in the case, and they feel it.
They have done nobly in the past, and have assumed great responsibilities
which cannot now be neglected or deferred. But here is the strangest of

all the facts in this series: With the urgency before them, <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">our
constituents
do not make a corresponding increase in their donations</span>.</p>

<p>We feel impelled to urge this upon the attention of pastors, churches
and individuals. Brethren and friends, do not delay as in the case of
slavery,
till the conflict comes! Do not expect that everybody else is doing
what is needed. The responsibility is personal and pressing, and each
individual
and church can meet it only by making larger gifts&mdash;not from an
impulse, but from a deliberate purpose formed under a sense of obligation
to the Negro, the Nation and to Christ.</p>

<h2>Rev. W.W. Patton, D.D., LL.D.</h2>

<p>The sudden and unexpected death of Dr. Patton takes away a man who
has made a shining mark in the various relations of pastor, secretary,
editor
and president of a university. All these responsible positions he has
filled with great fidelity and success. It becomes us to speak especially
of
his relations to this Association, which have been intimate and special. He
was one of the few men present at the formation of the American Missionary
Association in Albany in 1846, encountering the obloquy and ostracism
which was then attached to those who favored the new movement. In 1868
he became the Western Corresponding Secretary of the Association in
Chicago,
and held this position for about two years. In 1877 he accepted the
Presidency of Howard University in Washington, D.C., the theological
department of which is under the care of the Association, and in which
Dr. Patton was a teacher. Thus from the founding of the Association till
the time of his death, Dr. Patton had been connected with it, sometimes
officially, and always with deep sympathy and earnest co-operation.</p>

<p>He was in usual health, with his wonted vigor of body and mind, till
within a few hours of his death, and on the day on which that occurred, his
Presidency of Howard University expired by the terms of his resignation.
He seemed to be fitted for further usefulness, and had looked forward with
the expectation of using his pen and voice in the interests of the Master
whom he had so faithfully served, but the scene of his active enjoyment
and services was by that Master transferred to the higher realm.</p>

<h2>Revival At Straight University.</h2>


<p>President Hitchcock writes from Straight University: "Our meetings
during the 'week of prayer,' took on the character of revival meetings,
and I have never before seen the school so stirred. Every girl boarding in
Stone Hall is professedly converted, and there are not more than eight or
ten boys who are not in the same good way, and every one of these is
interested
and has asked for prayers. Rejoice with us and pray for us."</p>

<h2>The Indian.</h2>

<h2 class="sub">Address at the Annual Meeting in Chicago,</h2>

<p>By Rt. Rev. H.b. Whipple.</p>


<p>I accepted the kind invitation of my good brother, Rev. Dr. Strieby, to
address you, because I do believe that if the hedges which have been
builded in the garden of the Lord are ever taken away, it will be by
hearty,
believing work for our Saviour. The history of the North American Indians
is a sad story of wrongs. You may begin far back in the days of
our Puritan fathers, when Christian men marched to the music of a fife and
drum, with the head of King Philip on a pole, and then after prayer,
decided
that the sins of the father ought to be visited on the children, and
therefore sold his son as a slave to Bermuda; and you may follow down
to where the saintly Worcester, a Congregational missionary, was tried,
sentenced,
and went to the Penitentiary in Georgia for teaching Indians to
read; and so on to where a Moravian church of Christian Indians were
cruelly tortured and murdered; and so on to the last of our Indian wars,
and it is a dark story of robbery and wrongs&mdash;we have spent five hundred
millions on Indian wars, and have killed ten of our own people to every
one killed of the Indians. Thank God that by the efforts of Christian
men, the heart of the Nation has been touched, and to-day willing hands
and hearts are laboring for their Christian civilization.</p>

<p>When I went to my diocese thirty years ago, there were over twenty
thousand Indians in Minnesota. They had sunk to a depth of degradation
their heathen fathers had not known. Friends told me it was hopeless,
that they were a perishing race. I said if they are perishing, the more
reason to make haste to give to them the gospel. The picture was dark,
but not darker than that drawn by the pen of divine Inspiration in the
first
chapter of Romans. I carried it where I have learned to take all which
troubles me, and at my blessed Saviour's feet I promised I would never
turn my back on the Indian whom God had placed at my door, and I have
tried to keep the vow.</p>

<p>I can tell you the story of Indian missions by relating one incident.
Some years ago, Rev. Lord Charles Hervey went with me to the Indian
country. We had delightful services. After the Holy Communion we
were sitting on the green-sward near a house. The head chief said, "Your
friend came from across the great water; does he know the Indian's
history?"
I said "No." He said "I will tell him."</p>

<p>"Before the white man came, the forests and prairies were full of game,
the rivers and lakes were full of fish, the wild rice was Manidou gift to
the
red man. Would you like to see one of these Indians?" There stepped
out on the porch an Indian man and woman dressed in furs, ornamented
with porcupine quills. "There," said the chief, "my people were like
those before the white man came."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you what the white man did for us? He came and told

us we had no fire horses, no fire canoes, no houses. He said if we would
sell him our land, he would make us like white men. Shall I tell you what
he did? No, you had better see it." The door opened, and out stepped
a poor, degraded looking Indian, his face besmeared with mud, his
blanket in rags, no leggins, and by his side a poor, wretched looking woman
in a torn calico dress. The chief raised his hands and said, "Manido
Manido, is this an Indian?" The man bowed his head. "How came
this?" The Indian held up a black bottle and said, "This was the white
man's gift." Some of us bowed our heads in shame.</p>

<p>Said the chief, "If this were all, I would not have told you. Long
years ago a pale-faced man came to our country. He spoke kindly, and
seemed to want to help us, but our hearts were hard. We hated the white
man and would not listen. Every summer when the sun was so high, he
came. We always looked to see his tall form coming through the forest.
One year I said to my fellows, 'what does this man come for? He does
not trade with us, he never asks anything of us. Perhaps the Great Spirit
sent him.' We stopped to listen. Some of us have that story in our
hearts. Shall I tell you what it has done for us?" The door opened and
out stepped a young man&mdash;a clergyman&mdash;in a black frock coat, and by his
side a woman neatly dressed in a black alpaca dress. Said the chief,
"There is only one religion in the world which can lift a man out of the
mire and tell him to call God 'Father,' and that is the religion of Jesus
Christ."</p>

<p>We have had many deferred hopes, and sometimes it has been dark as
midnight. After nearly three years of hard work, I had both of my Indian
missions destroyed, church and mission house burned, and our western border
for three hundred miles desolated by an Indian massacre, which destroyed
the fairest portion of our State, and left eight hundred of our
citizens sleeping in nameless graves. It was needed to teach us that
nations
as well as individuals reap exactly what they sow. We began again.
Here and there some Indian would listen, and the gospel was the same to
him as to us. One day an Indian came to our missionary and said, "I
know this religion is true. The men who have walked in this new trail
are better and happier. But I have always been a warrior, and my hands
are full of blood. Could I be a Christian?" The missionary repeated the
story of God's love. To test the man he said, "May I cut your hair?" The
Indian wears his scalp lock for his enemy&mdash;when it is cut it is a sign he
will never go on the war-path again. The man said, "Yes, you may cut it;
I shall throw my old life away." It was cut. He started for home and
met some wild Indians who shouted with laughter, and with taunts said:
"Yesterday you were a warrior, to-day you are a squaw." It stung the
man to madness, and he rushed to his home and threw himself on the floor
and burst into tears. His wife was a Christian, and came and put her
arms about his neck and said: "Yesterday there was not a man in the

world who dared call you a coward. Can't you be as brave for Him who
died for you as you were to kill the Sioux?" He sprang to his feet and
said, "I can and I will." I have known many brave, fearless servants of
Christ, but I never knew one braver than this chief who is now in Paradise.</p>

<p>I wish I could take you to a Christian Indian's home. You might see
nothing but a plain log house, and you might wonder why the tears came
in my eyes as he said to me, "That is my daughter's room; the boys sleep
up stairs; this is for me and my wife." They are tears of joy, for I knew
them when they herded as swine, in a wigwam. It is the religion of Christ
which has brought respect for womanhood.</p>

<p>I want to take you far away in the forest to Red Lake. The head chief,
Mah-dwah-go-no-wind, was a remarkable man as a wild man, true, honest
and brave. He came and asked me to give him a missionary. I loved
him and we were warm friends. I said "I cannot give you a missionary for
the American Missionary Association has a missionary now in that field."
The chief came again and again to see me. He said: "I want your religion.
If you refuse I will ask the Roman Catholics." I wrote Rev. Dr.
Strieby, and told him the situation. I said "The field is in my diocese.
I have the right to send a missionary there, but ask your consent because I
will never be a party to present Christian divisions to heathen men."
After due deliberation, the Association consented. I am happy to tell
you that that old chief and nearly all the adults of his band
are faithful communicants. At my last visit, the chief came to
me and said, "My Father, since you were here, my old wife with
whom I have lived fifty years, has gone to sleep in the grave. I shall go
to
lie by her side. I have heard that white Christians bless the place where
they sleep as belonging to God. Will you bless the place where my wife
sleeps and ask God to care for it until he calls his children out of the
grave?" We formed a procession of the Indians, the clergy and the old
chief and myself, and marched around the place singing in Ojibway, "Jesus
lover of my soul"; then I read appropriate scripture, made an address
and offered prayer, and asked blessing on this "acre of God." After the
service the chief said: "I thank you for telling me I have a Saviour. I
thank you for blessing the place where my wife sleeps. I have your face
on my heart. Good bye."</p>

<p>I could keep you longer than I ought telling you of the lights and shadows
of missionary life. The North American Indian is the noblest type of
a wild man on the earth. He recognizes a Great Spirit, he loves his home,
he is passionately devoted to his people, and believes in a future life.
The
Ojibway language is a marvel. The verb has inflections by thousands. If
an Indian says "I love" and stops, you can tell by the inflection of the
verb whether he loves an animate or inanimate object, a man or a woman.
The nicest shade of meaning in St. Paul's Epistles could be conveyed in
Ojibway, and I have heard a missionary say, "A classic Greek temple
standing

in the forest would not be more marvelous than this wonderful language."</p>

<p>The Indians are heathen folk and will often come to the Christian life
fettered by old heathen ideas, and some may stumble and fall; they did in
St. Paul's time; but I can say that some of the noblest instances of the
power of religion I have ever known have been among these poor red men.
I can recall death-beds where an Indian looked up in my face and said,
"The Great Spirit has called me to go on the last journey. I am not
afraid to go, for Jesus is going with me, and I shall not be lonesome on
the
road."</p>

<p>I am happy to tell you that the clouds are breaking. Thousands of this
poor race are rejoicing in the light of the Gospel. The heart of the nation
has been touched, and thousands are laboring for their salvation. The
Indians are not decreasing. It is due to the absence of internecine wars,
to their protection from dangerous contagious diseases, to better medical
care and a wiser administration. In the future, Indians must have
citizenship,
but not until they are prepared for this precious boon. The ballot
cannot redeem humanity. I was asked by President Cleveland what I
thought of making the Indian a voter. I said, "It has been tried." Under
an old territorial law, any Indian who wore the civilized dress could
vote. I have heard of an election where a tribe of Indians were put
through a hickory shirt and pair of pants, and we know how that election
went. The Indian must have the protection of law. In his wild state he
has the "lex talionis." He becomes a Christian. A drunken wild man
kills his cow or insults his wife. He could punish the brute, but we have
taught him that he must not revenge his wrongs, and so the Christian Indian
is pitiably helpless. I can take you to an Indian village where property
and life are safe, where childhood, womanhood, and old age are cared
for, and it is due to the Gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>While missionary work must be carried on in the native tongue, the
schools ought to teach the English language&mdash;if schools are conducted only
in the heathen tongue, you not only have no Christian ideas, but when the
child has learned to read, he has no books. He should be taught in a
language which opens to him the literature, the science and the Christian
teaching of the Christian world. The Gospel of Jesus Christ will do for
the Indian what it has done for others through all the ages&mdash;give him
home, manhood and freedom.</p>

<p>Lastly&mdash;we are living in eventful times. One hundred years ago the
people who spoke the English tongue were less numerous than some of the
Latin races of Europe. To-day one hundred and fifty millions of people
speak the English language. When we remember how God made the
Greek tongue the language of the world to prepare for the first preaching
of the Gospel of His Son, may we not believe he designs to use our English
tongue to prepare for the second coming of our Lord?</p>


<p>Brethren, we hear a great deal about Indian problems, Negro problems,
and problems which hinder all work for God and man. When General
Sherman and other officers of the army were sent out to investigate that
awful massacre in Colorado, they wrote in their report: "The Indian
problem,
like all other human problems, can be solved by one sentence in an
old book&mdash;'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'"</p>

<h2>Letter From Miss Collins.</h2>


<p>I went to Oahe to take two girls to school, and was gone eleven days.
I travelled nearly three hundred miles, driving my ponies myself, and last
Sabbath held the services for Spotted Bear in the morning, as Mr. Riggs
was absent; taught a class in the afternoon, and returned to Cheyenne
agency on Monday, to find that the Indian man who went with me had returned
home. I visited the Government school there, and witnessed
Major McChesney issue the annuities to the Indians; found a party of
Indians coming this way as far as the Itazipco camp on the Moreau; came
with them so far&mdash;about forty-five miles from here&mdash;and from there Bessie,
Jumbo (my ponies) and I came on alone. I drove the forty-five miles in
one day, arriving here at dark.</p>

<p>At Cheyenne a number of fine-looking, well-dressed young Indian men
came up to me and addressed me in English. I did not recognize some
of them, and they told me they went to school to me in '75, '76 and '77.
I remember them as dirty little long-haired, blanket Indians. It made
my heart strong to take these manly young men by the hand and to hear
them say, "You were my first teacher."</p>

<p>One night, when I was coming home, we got into camp, and the Indian
tent had on one side a man and his wife, his son and daughter, and his baby
twins. On the other side of the fire, another man, wife and child, four
dogs, two puppies, and back of the fire a man and his wife and two young
men and myself. When supper was ready, the dogs were put outside, the
children hushed, and the head man said, "Winona pray." They were all
strangers to me but two of them, so you may know I was surprised. I
prayed, and when I finished, all said, "Ho, ho, ho," that is, all the men.
I
was
again surprised at the universal consent or endorsement of the petition. I
had some rich experiences, many hardships new to me, but I sowed seed
which I doubt not will spring up. A half-breed Indian, Joe Hodgkiss, and
his wife, were very kind to me.</p>

<p>When I got in sight of the house here, men stood all along the road
waiting to shake hands with me. I should not have undertaken the trip,
but the girls were about fifteen years old, and if they were not in school
this winter they never would be. I could not see the good material in them
wasted. Mr. Reed could not go, and he did not want Elias to leave his

school to go. So I hired a team and went. I am glad I did. God meant
me to get into the homes and hearts of those strangers, and I had no fear
but that he planned it all.</p>

<h2>Grand View, Tenn.</h2>


<p>A teacher writes: "Doubtless you have learned how full our school is.
We all feel that we <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">must</span> do something in some way to have more
buildings.
Several were obliged to go away last week, being unable to
secure boarding-places.
The dormitory is more than full. There are sixteen boys in four
small rooms; three boys occupy one end of the old store house near the
railroad. This warm weather is certainly favorable for them. Twenty
new pupils came one day. Others are expected to-morrow. Where shall
we put them? Nine in the main room are now without seats; chairs
were placed in the aisle. In the primary room it is just as full, forty-two
being crowded into space intended for thirty-two."</p>

<p>Another: "We are blessed with a deep religious awakening, which has
reached many of the students."</p>

<h2>Bureau Of Woman's Work.</h2>

<p>Miss D.E. Emerson, Secretary.</p>

<a name="toc_15"></a>

<p>In reading our list of Missionaries and Mission Stations, ladies will
recognize many familiar names of those in whom they have become
particularly interested through contributions to the work.</p>

<p>Maine ladies will find their four teachers for whose support they have
become responsible.</p>

<p>Vermont ladies will look at the McIntosh School with a sense of
proprietorship, and rejoice in its enlargement.</p>

<p>Massachusetts and Rhode Island may find their four teachers sustained
by the Woman's Home Missionary Association, and many Massachusetts
ladies who have been especially interested in the school at Tougaloo may
rejoice to be connected with such an institution.</p>

<p>Connecticut ladies have done much for their school at Thomasville,
Ga., although not as largely through their State Union. This school was
begun through the liberality of a Connecticut lady, and for its continuance
and development this Association depends upon the Bureau of Woman's
Work. Contributions from all sources are solicited.</p>

<p>The New York Union abides by its principles to increase its contribution
each year, and in addition to the support of three missionaries,
pledges six hundred dollars to the general work.</p>


<p>The Ohio Union comes forward also with an appropriation to the
general work, additional to the support of four missionaries.</p>

<p>The Illinois Union continues its support to two missionaries, and hopes
for a third during the year.</p>

<p>If the ladies of Michigan will look at the Athens, Ala., Trinity School
in our list, they will see their own State represented there, an incentive,
we
trust, to special effort toward the sum recommended by the officers of
their
Union.</p>

<p>The ladies of Minnesota have the opportunity to aid the school at
Jonesboro, Tennessee, and if they carry out the recommendation of their
Minnesota Missionary Society, they will this year sustain in full the two
lady teachers.</p>

<p>The other Missionary Unions represented in our list have shown especial
interest, and nearly all have made such pledge of help as will soon secure
them a special representative in the field.</p>

<p>A Children's Missionary is sustained by ladies and children, and special
work is also assigned to Christian Endeavor Societies.</p>

<br />

<p>Thus it will be seen that the long list of Ladies' Societies shown each
month as co-operating with us, is not merely in name. We really have
their help, and a careful reading of our list of missionaries will make
clear
that we not only need their help, but can give them much more to do.</p>

<p>A lady recently brought to us five hundred dollars as the result of her
personal effort, and when we expressed to her our thanks she exclaimed,
"Don't say a word; it is <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">my</span> work as well as yours." Let us be
workers
together.</p>

<p>In sending your money to your State officers, do not fail to designate
it as for the <span class="hi" style="font-style: italic;">American Missionary Association</span>.</p>

<p>The Way One Mission Band in Iowa raised its money&mdash;"Our society
was organized in 1888, and the first year we sent twenty dollars for Beach
Institute. We have about twenty members, from five to thirteen years of
age. We meet once a month through the summer, but close for the winter.
Last summer I gave to all over ten years of age a nickel, and those
under ten a penny to see how much they could gain. These are a few of
the reports. One little boy with his nickel bought a sitting of eggs from
which he raised eleven chickens, which he sold for two dollars and twenty
cents. Another raised nine chickens which he sold for two dollars.
Another bought a little turkey, which he sold at Thanksgiving for a dollar
and ten cents. Another with a penny bought a squash vine, from which
he sold five large squashes for fifty-five cents. Another bought a row of
potatoes for which he received fifty cents, and so the pennies multiplied.
I gave mite-boxes to all in the spring, and so at the end of the year we
are
able again to send you the neat little sum of twenty-five dollars."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
